# Advanced Regression Techniques: Top 7% Solution

This repository contains a detailed Jupyter notebook that outlines the process and techniques used to achieve a top 7% leaderboard score in the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. The approach is centered around the use of ElasticNet, a linear regression model, complemented by extensive feature engineering and the incorporation of interaction terms.

## Overview

The project is structured as a single, comprehensive Jupyter notebook that guides the reader through the entire process of tackling the Ames Housing dataset regression problem. The notebook is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a specific part of the data science workflow, including data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model fitting.

### Features

- **Data Processing:** Handling of missing values, encoding of categorical variables, creation and transformation of features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Distribution analysis, correlation studies, and significance testing of SalePrice variations.
- **Model Fitting:** Outlier removal, optimization of various regression models, and the use of feature interactions to enhance model performance.

### Highlights

- Unique approaches to data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Detailed EDA with insights on feature importance and data distribution.
- Model optimization techniques, with a focus on ElasticNet and Lasso.
- Inclusion of interaction terms based on model insights to improve predictions.
